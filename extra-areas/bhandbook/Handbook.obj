key useless~
This key is completely useless since it cannot be picked up and to get
to it, the door it unlocks must be unlocked... hmmmmm, I'm sure that
there is some obscure reason for it though...
~
E
reason~
There is absolutely no reason for this key except to be an ignorant item
that no one can get.  The bonuses are in case some Id's it and should be
ignored since the item cannot be used anyways.
