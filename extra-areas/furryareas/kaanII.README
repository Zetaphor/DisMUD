These zones are all free for the taking, however they are not formatted 
to stock Circle as the zones in 'kaan' are. There are additional 
bitvectors in every file of every zone and the zones are all numbered.

The zones are all built from a Circle based MUD, however there have
been many modifications to the MUD they hail from. In most of the obj
files, the color format that is used is: /c (and the first letter of
the color). The obj files are primarily the files that use color, maybe
even the only files (there are 16 zones here.. I don't really remember
if any of the wld or mob files make use of any color ;-) so you will
want to check them all thoroughly or else every obj in the zone will
read '/cwa /ccsharp /cwsword/c0'.

If you have any trouble with the zones or want to see them 'live and
in person' log onto bb4.betterbox.net port 5150 and check them out.
I'm usually on most every day.


Have fun -
