These zones are all circle-based zones, with the stock circle format
excepting one - Labyrinth.ZIP which has some added bitvectors in the
wld, obj, and mob files.

All were built by me - Kaan - my web page at dibrova.betterbox.net/~dibrova/
can verify that these are originals. All of these and then some are on my
site, along with my email and MUD addy for any additional questions you
may have.

I hope these can be posted here.
