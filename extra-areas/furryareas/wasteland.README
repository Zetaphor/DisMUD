I hereby present the wasteland area, availiable to those concerned.

I have, deliberately, written short long_descriptions. Because I
consider them more useful that way, since most DIKU's are not inclined
towards questing.

Hopefully the area is relatively balanced with the rest of the new 
CircleMUD-3.0 world, but one never knows as it's not been tested in a 
running MUD.
