 * These are definitions which control the guildmasters for each class.

 * The first field (top line) controls the highest percentage skill level
 * a character of the class is allowed to attain in any skill.  (After
 * this level, attempts to practice will say "You are already learned in
 * this area."
 *
 * The second line controls the maximum percent gain in learnedness a
 * character is allowed per practice -- in other words, if the random
 * die throw comes out higher than this number, the gain will only be
 * this number instead.
 *
 * The third line controls the minimu percent gain in learnedness a
 * character is allowed per practice -- in other words, if the random
 * die throw comes out below this number, the gain will be set up to
 * this number.
 *
 * The fourth line simply sets whether the character knows 'spells'
 * or 'skills'.  This does not affect anything except the message given
 * to the character when trying to practice (i.e. "You know of the
 * following spells" vs. "You know of the following skills"
